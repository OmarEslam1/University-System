University Management System - Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Overview
This repository contains the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for the University Management System, a software application designed to streamline administrative and academic processes within a university. The system automates tasks such as student enrollment, course management, faculty administration, grade tracking, and more, aiming to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility.
The SRS document was prepared as part of the CSE322 - Software Engineering course and submitted by:

Omar Eslam Abdelhamid (ID: 120210190)

Supervisor: Prof. Ehab Elshazly
Purpose
The University Management System aims to provide a centralized platform to manage university operations, including:

Student registration and academic progress tracking
Course creation, scheduling, and enrollment
Faculty profile management and course assignments
Grading and academic feedback
Administrative tasks such as financial data and resource allocation

This SRS outlines the system's purpose, scope, actors, functional and non-functional requirements, and design specifications to guide its development.
